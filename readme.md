# Export Auto Clicker

This is an extension which adds a button for each row on the Video Producer page.

These inserted buttons, when pressed, will auto click the three dots on the right => Export => Start Export (with a short 1 second countdown so you can cancel if you're fast enough after a miss click.)

# DANGER

**Do not install this extension if you do not know the author. Never install extensions you cannot trust.**

# Installation and Usage

- Use a chromium based browser
  - If you're using a browser in the Firefox family, I can recommend temporarily using [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) or [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
- Click the green `Code` button at the top
- Download the zip file
- Extract it
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer mode
- Load unpacked
- Select the extracted extension folder (the selected folder should contain a `manifest.json` file)
- Make sure the `Export Auto Clicker` extension is enabled
- Make sure it is pinned (visible in the bar at the top on your browser)
- Go to https://dashboard.twitch.tv
- Go to Content
- Go to Video Producer
- Click through to whichever page you want to export VODs to YouTube from
- Click the `Export Auto Clicker` button (`E`) in your pinned extensions
- Click `Add Export Buttons`
- Click `^ Start Export ^` for the VOD you wish to export
